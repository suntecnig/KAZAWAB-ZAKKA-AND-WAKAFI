1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now before you start,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
here are 10 quick considerations on how to take this course.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And I promise they are super short and super important.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, please don't skip this video.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And first of all,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
there are many different types of students in this course.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Some have never programmed in their life,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
others have experienced with other languages,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but not with JavaScript.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And even others have some experience with JavaScript,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but want to become even more advanced.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And this course is for all of you, everyone is welcome.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So, please don't write a bad review right away

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
if the course is too easy

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
or too hard

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
or progressing too slow or too fast for you.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I built this course with everyone in mind.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now, to make the course perfect for you,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
you can always rewatch lectures,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
jump to other more advanced sections,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
watch the course with slower or faster playback speed,

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
or ask questions in the Q&A section.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Of course you can give a one-star review

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
if the course is absolutely terrible,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but please, at least wait a couple of sections

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to get a good idea of the course.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now, about actually taking the course,

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
you need to code along with me.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And this is crucial,

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
you will learn exactly zero JavaScript skills

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
by just sitting and watching me code.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, you have to code yourself,

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
even if you're just typing the same code

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
as I am typing in the video.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It doesn't matter as long as you're coding.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Next, try all the coding challenges.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Do the best that you can,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but if you get stuck for too long,

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
then simply watch the solution.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And I can't stress this enough,

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you have to try the coding challenges,

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because otherwise, you will miss

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
half of the learning opportunity in this course.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And please don't beat yourself up

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
if you can figure out the solution.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is completely normal, trust me.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And figuring out the solution,

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
is actually not even the main point of these challenges.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So, if that happens,

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
just rewatch the lectures that were covered,

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
try to understand them better and move on.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you want the course material to stick, then take notes.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Notes on code syntax,

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
notes on theory concepts,

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and really notes on everything.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You can't take too many notes,

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and everyone has their own style,

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
so, just find yours.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now, if this is your first time ever programming,

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
then please don't get overwhelmed.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's 100% normal that will not understand everything

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
at the beginning.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Just keep going through the first few sections,

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
even if you don't understand everything at first,

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you soon will, believe me.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But please just don't think,

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I guess coding is not for me.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That thought is simply not allowed here, okay?

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, keep in mind that everyone

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
has different learning speeds.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have seen tens of thousands of students,

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
progressing through my courses,

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
so, believe me,

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
this is completely normal.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In the first couple of sections of the course,

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
don't bother understanding exactly why things work

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the way they do in JavaScript.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Also in the beginning,

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
don't stress about efficient code,

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
or fast code, or clean code.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's all super important,

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
don't get me wrong.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But in the first few sections while still learning,

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
we just want to make things to work.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We will understand the why, later in the course,

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and of course make the code clean as well.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The sections in the course built on one another.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So, before moving on from a section,

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
make sure that you understand exactly what was covered.

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, take a break,

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
review the code that we wrote,

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
review your notes

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and review the projects that we built.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And maybe even write some code yourself

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
in order to practice.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Only then, you're ready to move on.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If you ever have an error in your code,

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
or a question,

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
always start by trying to solve it yourself,

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
because this is absolutely essential for your progress.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now, if you cannot solve the problem,

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
then check the Q&A section,

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
because someone probably already had

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the same problem before.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And if that doesn't help either,

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
then just ask a new question.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And to do that,

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
use a short description,

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
post your code on codepen.io,

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and shared the link in the Q&A.

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Because without the code,

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
we will not be able to help you.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I built and recorded this course on a Mac,

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
but everything works the exact same way on Windows or Linux.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So, if something doesn't work on your computer,

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
it's not because you're using

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
a different operating system, okay?

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And now, finally,

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and most importantly, have fun.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Coding is a lot of fun.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And it's so rewarding to see something

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
that you have built yourself.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So, if you're feeling frustrated for some reason,

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
stop whatever you're doing and come back later.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Always, always have fun while coding, okay?

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And with that being said, let's now get started.
